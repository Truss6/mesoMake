# mesoMake
Program for resolving overlaps in a system of circles for materials research

I wrote this program to address a problem I had, but I couldn't find existing software for.

version mesoMake2-mesoMake5 are written in a single file, and have varying options
  2&4 are 2D, while 3&5 are 3D
  4&5 have zoning (domain decomposition)
  2&3 do not

mesomake.py is written to be more user freindly, it is 2D, with zoning.
